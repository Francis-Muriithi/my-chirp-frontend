# About My Chirp

My Chirp is a web-based application that provides a soolution to adventurers and hikers who are also serious about bird-watching (chirp is the sound made by birds). The application allows these users an opportunity to keep a log of all the birds they encounter in their adventures and to complete a research of the same birds, adding descriptions and other tags as they so wish. 

## Application Environments
The application is created in VS Code and deployed on netlify. The information about the birds and the adventures is stored in a backend created in Ruby on Rails and deployed on heroku. The links for both the deployed sites are provided in the last section of this README.md.

For reproduction, you can clone this repository and run npm install to get access to the code and create a remote source for yourself. Running npm start will run the application on your local environment and you will be in a position to experience the functionality of the application.
